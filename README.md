## 📦 What is Pandas?

**Pandas** (short for _Panel Data_) is a high-performance, easy-to-use library for structured data operations. It is widely used in data science, finance, statistics, and many other fields.

With Pandas, you can:

- 📊 Handle **tabular data** using `DataFrame` objects
- 🧮 Perform **data cleaning**, **filtering**, and **aggregation**
- 🧾 Read and write data from formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, etc.
- 📌 Perform **grouping**, **merging**, and **pivoting**
- 📈 Generate simple plots directly from your data
- 🚀 Efficiently work with large datasets
